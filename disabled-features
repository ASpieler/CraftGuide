buildcraft recipes (causing build errors. But I don't have BC installed on my server anyway, so didn't fix that)

IC2 exp recycler recipes (it only produces scrap... and cause gameplay errors)

some liquid icons? (class Fluid doesn't have a getStillIcon() method... causing build errors. 
didn't know why and coudn't find a replacement so I just disabled it (by setting the icon directly to 'null'))
(but i didn't find what's influenced in the gameplay)
